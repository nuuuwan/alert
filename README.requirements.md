# ALERT - Requirements

*ALERT = Awareness, Logistics, Evacuation, Recovery and Tracking Platform*

# Functionality Requirements

## v0 – Immediate usefulness during a crisis

1. Live weather alerts  
2. Active disaster layer on the map, showing floods, landslides, storms, road closures, power outages, where data is available.  
3. Emergency contacts widget pinned on the map edge, offering tap-to-call for police, ambulance, fire, local authorities.  
4. Safe places: manually curated list of hospitals, police stations, fire stations, DSDs, GNDs, and known evacuation centres.  
5. Neighbourhood risk overlays: Flood risk zones, landslide risk zones, tsunami zones.  
6. Offline mode (basic): Cached map tiles for user’s home area and stored emergency numbers.  
7. Location sharing (opt-in): Simple “I’m safe” or “I need assistance” pin that users can send via WhatsApp or SMS.  
8. Minimal admin dashboard for authorities to add or update shelters and notices.

## v1 – Structured disaster response

1. Automated data feeds from meteorology, disaster management, and police APIs
2. Dynamic routing that avoids flooded or blocked roads and directs to the nearest safe location.  
3. Shelter capacity indicators where data is available, or manual update interface.  
4. User alerts: geofenced push notifications when entering a high-risk or restricted area.  
5. Community reports: lightweight, moderated system for users to report hazards, fallen trees, blocked roads or supply shortages.

## v2 – Preparedness and community resilience

1. Household preparedness plans wizard, saved locally.  
2. Checklists and local guidance for floods, storms, landslides, heatwaves, etc.  
3. Neighbourhood readiness score combining public data and community inputs.  
4. Volunteer coordination: registration of local volunteers, blood donors, medical professionals.  
5. Resource mapping: places to get sandbags, clean water points, battery-charging sites during outages.  
6. Historical incident map showing past floods, fires or crimes, to inform community planning.

## v3 – Full ecosystem and predictive capabilities

1. Predictive alerts using weather models and risk probabilities for micro-areas.  
2. Integration with government workflow so authorities can push advisories, manage shelters, and verify community reports.  
3. Mesh network or peer-to-peer fallback comms for when the mobile network is down.  
4. Supply chain and relief-flow visualisation to show where aid is available or delayed.  
5. AI-assisted summarisation of evolving situations: road closures, rainfall trends, risk hotspots.  
6. Multi-hazard simulation mode for training communities and schools.

# Non-Functional Requirements

1. Tri-Lingual  
2. Cross-Platform  
3. Poor network connectivity-Friendly  
4. Privacy-by-Design
