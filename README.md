# ALERT

*ALERT = Awareness, Logistics, Evacuation, Recovery and Tracking Platform*

## Vision

**ALERT is the Awareness, Logistics, Evacuation, Recovery and Tracking platform for Sri Lanka. Its vision is to become the country’s dependable backbone for public safety and community resilience.**

ALERT will be the app Sri Lankans open first when the weather turns or the ground shifts. It will bring floods, landslides, cyclones, storm surges, road closures, and outages into one view. It will work even with weak connectivity. It will offer clear guidance in Sinhala, Tamil, and English so people can act without hesitation.

It will link the public with authorities such as the Met Department, the Disaster Management Centre, police, and provincial councils. It will pull in automated feeds and verified notices. It will give safe-route navigation and geofenced alerts. Moderated community reports will add ground truth without clutter.

It will help people prepare for recurring risks. It will offer family plans, checklists, and simple guidance for floods, landslides, cyclones, heatwaves, lightning, and droughts. It will map volunteers and essential resources. It will show neighbourhood readiness in practical terms.

It will grow into a predictive ecosystem. It will warn early using local data and risk models. It will keep working through mesh communication when networks fail. It will help authorities manage shelters and validate reports. It will turn fast-changing crises into clear, usable information for everyone.
