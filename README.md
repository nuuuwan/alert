# ALERT (Awareness, Logistics, Evacuation, Recovery and Tracking) App

## v0 – MVP: Immediate usefulness during a crisis

- Live weather alerts (fact: push or pull from official meteorological sources).
- Active disaster layer on the map, showing floods, landslides, storms, road closures, power outages, where data is available.
- Emergency contacts widget pinned on the map edge, offering tap-to-call for police, ambulance, fire, local authorities.
- Safe places: manually curated list of hospitals, police stations, fire stations, and known evacuation centres.
- Offline mode (basic): cached map tiles for user’s home area and stored emergency numbers.
- Location sharing (opt-in): simple I’m safe or I need assistance pin that users can send via WhatsApp or SMS.
- Minimal admin dashboard for you to add or update shelters and notices.

## v1 – Structured disaster response

- Automated data feeds from meteorology, disaster management, and police APIs (fact: depends on available public APIs).
- Dynamic routing that avoids flooded or blocked roads and directs to nearest safe location.
- Shelter capacity indicators where data is available, or manual update interface.
- Neighbourhood risk overlays: flood risk zones, landslide risk zones, tsunami zones.
- User alerts: geofenced push notifications when entering a high-risk or restricted area.
- Community reports: lightweight, moderated system for users to report hazards, fallen trees, blocked roads or supply shortages.

## v2 – Preparedness and community resilience

- Household preparedness plans wizard, saved locally.
- Checklists and local guidance for floods, storms, landslides, heatwaves, etc.
- Neighbourhood readiness score combining public data and community inputs.

- Resource mapping: places to get sandbags, clean water points, battery-charging sites during outages.
- Historical incident map showing past floods, fires or crimes, to inform community planning.

## v3 – Full ecosystem and predictive capabilities

- Predictive alerts using weather models and risk probabilities for micro-areas.
- Integration with government workflow so authorities can push advisories, manage shelters, and verify community reports.
- Mesh network or peer-to-peer fallback comms for when the mobile network is down.
- Supply chain and relief-flow visualisation to show where aid is available or delayed.
- AI-assisted summarisation of evolving situations: road closures, rainfall trends, risk hotspots.
- Multi-hazard simulation mode for training communities and schools.
